# MindMedVR

## A dynamic guided meditation experience using real-time feedback from your brain

### Our purpose
Using EEG electrodes the MindMedVR app can process electrical waves from your brain to determine how stressed you are. Using more heavily guided miditation when your brain is stressed, MindMedVR aims to effectively calm down highly stressed doctors and nurses working in highly stressful environments before they perform major operations. As a result, their overall mental health and their ability to perform medical operations will improve significantly.
